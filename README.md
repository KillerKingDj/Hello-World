I just want to start by telling alittle about myself. i am currently an IT working on a server for my partner, im trying to get everything set up but continue to run into issues, im trying to get openvpn to work with me on kali 2019 rollover as well as a server for his company but either kali doesnt install correctly or completely or when it does openvpn doesnt want to work with me. anyway im just looking to have fun learning and sharing on here as much as i can!
